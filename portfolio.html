    <h1><strong>About Me:</strong></h1>
    <h2><em>My name is Caitlyn Mitchell.</em></h2>
  <div class="link"><p> I am 27 years old, living in the Portland metro area. 
    This year I made the decision to learn how to code with Epicodus.
    I'm really excited for this new journey! I love spending time 
    with my family. I enjoy my free time in the outdoors as often as 
    I can. I'm a pretty big Marvel fan (Spider-man is the greatest of 
    all time, obviously.). My friends and I started up a podcast called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2K9RmHrX5hElwPLh3etcRe?si=_Qj_bPerR0yZJdyq64932w">'Round Table Of Madness'</a> where we talk about the MCU (Marvel Cinematic 
    Universe).</p>
